This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

1. Our long term ultimate goal is develop a new browser out of Chromium. 
2. For now, for this project, our final goal is download a proper copy/version to local, 
and then compile in local and run it in local. 
3. But I do not want to messed up this local mac settings/env as well, not sure how to isolate an env at some level.
