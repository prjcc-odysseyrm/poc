## üîß VERSION CONTROL STRATEGY

### Branching Model: **Modified Trunk-Based Development**

Following Chromium's proven approach with team customizations:

#### Branch Types
1. **main** - Tracks upstream Chromium (read-only for team)
2. **develop** - Team integration branch (default for PRs)
3. **feature/*** - Individual feature development
4. **release/*** - Release preparation and hotfixes
5. **experimental/*** - Research and prototyping

#### Workflow Process
```bash
# 1. Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/awesome-new-feature

# 2. Develop and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add awesome new feature"

# 3. Create pull request to develop
git push origin feature/awesome-new-feature
# Create PR: feature/awesome-new-feature ‚Üí develop

# 4. After review and merge, cleanup
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/awesome-new-feature
```

## üõ†Ô∏è TEAM DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

### Build Infrastructure

#### Option 1: Shared Build Server (Recommended)
- **Setup**: Dedicated build machine (Mac Studio/Pro)
- **Benefit**: Team shares build artifacts, faster iteration
- **Cost**: Higher upfront, lower ongoing

#### Option 2: Individual Builds
- **Setup**: Each developer builds locally
- **Benefit**: Complete independence
- **Cost**: Lower upfront, higher ongoing (time + resources)

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Core developers**: Full build capability
- **Feature developers**: Use shared artifacts
- **Balance**: Flexibility with efficiency

### Development Tools

#### Code Editor Setup
**VS Code Extensions:**
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "ms-vscode.cpptools",
    "llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd",
    "vadimcn.vscode-lldb",
    "ms-python.python"
  ]
}
```

#### Required macOS Tools
- **Xcode 16+** (full version, not Command Line Tools)
- **Git 2.39+**
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Node.js** (for any web tooling)

## üéØ FEATURE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

### Phase 1: Feature Planning
1. **Feature specification** in team-docs repository
2. **Technical design** review with team
3. **UI/UX mockups** and approval
4. **Implementation estimate** and timeline

### Phase 2: Development Cycle
```bash
# Day 1: Setup feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature

# Day 2-N: Iterative development
# Small commits, frequent pushes
git commit -m "feat: implement core functionality"
git commit -m "style: update UI components"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests"

# Regular integration
git rebase develop  # Keep up with team changes
```

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
1. **Local testing** with debug build
2. **Create pull request** for code review
3. **Automated CI testing** (builds, tests, performance)
4. **Team review** and approval
5. **Merge to develop** branch

### Phase 4: Release Preparation
1. **Release candidate** from develop branch
2. **Comprehensive testing** on multiple devices
3. **Performance benchmarking**
4. **Security review**
5. **Tag release** and distribute

## üìä RECOMMENDED TOOLCHAIN

### Essential Development Tools
- **Code**: VS Code with C++/Clang extensions
- **Debug**: LLDB, Chrome DevTools
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub/GitLab
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- **Communication**: Slack/Discord + GitHub Issues
- **Project Management**: Linear, GitHub Projects, or Jira

### Build Optimization
```bash
# Fast incremental builds
ninja -C out/Debug chrome          # Debug build (faster compile)
ninja -C out/Release chrome        # Release build (optimized)

# Parallel builds (use all CPU cores)
ninja -j$(nproc) -C out/Debug chrome
```

## üîê SECURITY & ACCESS CONTROL

### Repository Access Levels
1. **Admin**: Project leads, senior developers
2. **Write**: Core team members, feature developers  
3. **Read**: QA, designers, stakeholders
4. **External**: Open source contributors (if applicable)

### Code Review Requirements
- **Minimum 2 reviewers** for main features
- **Security review** for network/crypto code
- **Performance review** for UI/rendering changes
- **Automated testing** must pass before merge

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

### Development Velocity
- **Feature delivery**: Target 2-3 features per 6-week cycle
- **Bug resolution**: <48 hours for critical, <1 week for normal
- **Build health**: >95% success rate on CI

### Code Quality
- **Test coverage**: >80% for new code
- **Code review**: <24 hours average review time
- **Documentation**: All features documented

## üö® CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Legal & Licensing
- **Chromium License**: BSD-style, compatible with commercial use
- **Attribution**: Maintain Chromium credits and licenses
- **Trademark**: Cannot use "Chrome" branding
- **Patents**: Review Google's patent license terms

### Upstream Tracking
- **Regular syncing** with Chromium main (monthly recommended)
- **Security updates** must be integrated quickly
- **Breaking changes** from upstream need team coordination

## üìÖ IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

### Week 1-2: Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Create organization repositories
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Team access and permissions
- [ ] Development environment docs

### Week 3-4: Team Onboarding
- [ ] Developer environment setup
- [ ] First feature branch creation
- [ ] Code review process training
- [ ] Build and test procedures

### Week 5-6: First Feature Cycle
- [ ] Feature planning and assignment
- [ ] Development and testing
- [ ] Integration and release preparation
- [ ] Process refinement

## üîÑ MAINTENANCE STRATEGY

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Sync with upstream Chromium updates
- **Monthly**: Security patch integration
- **Quarterly**: Major feature releases
- **Yearly**: Chromium version major updates

### Resource Management
- **Disk space monitoring**: Build artifacts grow over time
- **CI/CD costs**: Optimize for team size and frequency
- **Update coordination**: Planned upstream integration windows

This strategy balances Chromium's proven development practices with your team's need for agility and customization.
